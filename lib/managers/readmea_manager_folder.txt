This folder is usually named to ViewModel in other projects according to MVVM architecture. But in this case we have decided
to name it managers because it is more descriptive. But the strcutre is the same as MVVM. We have applied other methodologies
such as SOLID principles, DRY and KISS as well to make the application more maintainable, sustainable and scalable.

Make sure to follow this implementation structure to ensure quality and consistency.
