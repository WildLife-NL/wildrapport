

This folder is meant ONLY and ONLY to collect all the models that are used in the application.

Models are compareable to classes including enums. So everything that has to do with classes/enums or
models should be in this folder.

You might want to have your models in their specific folder within the model folder to create a more readable structure.
This dependes on your use case.

Make sure to follow this implementation structure to ensure quality and consistency.
