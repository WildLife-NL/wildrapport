# Backend Timestamp Corruption Issue

**Date:** 03/12/2025  
**Project:** Wildlife NL - Wild Rapport App  
**Issue:** Location tracking sends correctly, but backend stores wrong timestamps

---

## What

The app **sends location data every 10 seconds** with correct timestamps, but the **backend stores incorrect timestamps** that are off by 5-13 minutes (randomly).

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ App sends GPS location every 10 seconds (verified in logs)
- ✅ App includes correct UTC timestamp in request
- ✅ Backend returns 200 OK (accepts the data)
- ❌ Backend overwrites client timestamp with wrong server time
- ❌ Timestamps in database don't match what was sent
- ❌ Time differences are random: +5 min, -13 min, +19 min, etc.
- ❌ Sometimes backend reuses the same timestamp for multiple readings

**Impact:**
- 5-minute time filter shows 0 results (data looks "old")
- Cannot show real-time location tracking history
- Tracking visualization breaks for recent data
- 24-hour fallback needed to show any data

**Evidence:** Real examples from Android device testing on 03/12/2025:
- App sends `2025-12-03T13:09:57.713531Z` → Backend stores `2025-12-03T12:56:27.712542Z` (-13m 30s) ❌
- App sends `2025-12-03T12:56:37.715608Z` → Backend stores `2025-12-03T13:07:17.715813Z` (+10m 40s) ❌
- App sends `2025-12-03T13:10:07.712739Z` → Backend stores `2025-12-03T13:05:07.715479Z` (-5 min) ❌

---

## Why

**Client Timestamps Are Essential:**
GPS location readings must be timestamped at the **moment of GPS fix**, not when sent to server. Without client timestamps:
1. GPS reading taken at 13:00:00 (cached due to no internet)
2. Connection restored at 13:15:00
3. Reading sent to server and timestamped as 13:15:00 ❌
4. **Problem:** Looks like user was there 15 minutes later than reality

With client timestamps (correct approach):
1. GPS reading taken at 13:00:00 → timestamp: 13:00:00
2. No internet, cache locally
3. Connection restored at 13:15:00
4. Reading sent with original timestamp (13:00:00) ✅
5. **Correct:** Data shows accurate time

**Importance for Wildlife Observations:**
Accurate timestamps let observers correlate location with time of observation, reconstruct movement patterns, and match GPS data with encounter reports.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Client sends: ISO 8601 UTC string (e.g., `2025-12-03T13:03:07.715637Z`)
- Backend should: Use `body.time` field (preserve client timestamp)
- Backend currently: Generates own timestamp, ignoring client value (WRONG)

---

## How

### 1. Client Implementation (Correct)

**File:** `lib/managers/api_managers/tracking_cache_manager.dart`  
**Lines:** 140-160 (Timer.periodic sending every 10 seconds)

**What this does:**
- Uses `Timer.periodic` to trigger every 10 seconds
- Gets current GPS position
- Creates UTC timestamp at exact moment
- Sends both position AND timestamp to backend
- Timestamp is in ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix (UTC indicator)

**File:** `lib/data_managers/tracking_api.dart`  
**Lines:** 80-120 (addTrackingReading method with timestamp in request)

**What this does:**
1. Logs the exact timestamp being sent
2. Includes timestamp in request body as `"time"` field
3. Sends as ISO 8601 UTC string
4. Logs backend's response for debugging
5. Logs the timestamp backend returns (reveals the discrepancy)

### 2. Diagnostic Logging

**Added to track the issue:**
```dart
debugPrint('[TrackingApi] Sending location: $lat, $lon at $timestampUtc');
// Shows: Sending location: 51.700169, 5.2700516 at 2025-12-03T13:03:07.715637Z

debugPrint('[TrackingApi] Response body: ${response.body}');
// Shows: {"timestamp":"2025-12-03T13:22:17.715567Z",...}
//        ↑ Notice: Different timestamp!
```

**This revealed:**
- Client sends: `2025-12-03T13:03:07.715637Z`
- Backend returns: `2025-12-03T13:22:17.715567Z` (19 minutes different!)
- **Proof:** Backend is ignoring client timestamp and generating its own

### 3. Verification Through Logs

**Test conducted:** Running app on Android device for 5 minutes

**Expected behavior:**
- Send 30 readings (every 10 seconds × 5 minutes ÷ 2)
- All timestamps should be ~10 seconds apart
- Timestamps should match current time

**Actual behavior from logs:**
```
13:02:37 → Backend stores as 13:07:17 (+4 min 40s) ❌
13:02:47 → Backend stores as 13:02:27 (-20s) ❌
13:02:57 → Backend stores as 13:07:27 (+4 min 30s) ❌
13:03:07 → Backend stores as 13:22:17 (+19 min!) ❌
13:03:17 → Backend stores as 13:03:47 (+30s) ❌
13:03:27 → Backend stores as 13:22:27 (+19 min!) ❌
```

**Analysis:**
- Time differences are inconsistent (not a simple timezone offset)
- Backend sometimes reuses the same timestamp for different readings
- Backend adds random amounts: +19 min, +4 min, +30 sec, -20 sec
- **Conclusion:** Backend timestamp generation is broken, not just offset

### 4. Testing Offline Caching

**File:** `lib/managers/api_managers/tracking_cache_manager.dart`  
**Lines:** 50-90 (sendTrackingReading method with offline caching)

**What this shows:**
- When offline: Readings cached with original timestamp
- When online: All cached readings sent with original timestamps preserved
- Each reading includes exact timestamp from moment it was captured

**Testing result:**
1. Disabled WiFi on device
2. App cached 360 readings locally (preserving timestamps)
3. Re-enabled WiFi
4. App sent all 360 cached readings
5. Each reading sent with its original timestamp ✅
6. Backend corrupted all 360 timestamps ❌

**This proves:**
- Client-side caching works correctly
- Timestamps are preserved through offline period
- When sent later, original timestamp is still included
- Backend is the source of the problem, not client

### 5. Current Workaround

**File:** `lib/screens/location/kaart_overview_screen.dart`  
**Lines:** 450-480 (24-hour fallback filtering in _loadTrackingHistory)

**Why this helps:**
- 5-minute filter fails because backend timestamps are wrong
- 24-hour filter is wide enough to catch the corrupted data
- User still sees their path (546 readings from "today")
- Message explains why showing 24h instead of 5min

**Trade-off:**
- Cannot show truly real-time tracking (last 5 minutes)
- Shows broader time window than intended
- Performance acceptable (546 points still renders smoothly)

## Backend Investigation Needed

### What Backend Team Should Check

**1. API Endpoint Implementation**
```
POST /tracking-reading/
```

**Check if backend is doing this (wrong):**
```python
# Python/Django example (WRONG implementation)
def create_tracking_reading(request):
    data = json.loads(request.body)
    
    # ❌ WRONG: Ignoring client's timestamp
    reading = TrackingReading.objects.create(
        user=request.user,
        latitude=data['latitude'],
        longitude=data['longitude'],
        timestamp=timezone.now()  # ❌ Server generates timestamp
    )
```

**Should be doing this (correct):**
```python
# Python/Django example (CORRECT implementation)
def create_tracking_reading(request):
    data = json.loads(request.body)
    
    # ✅ CORRECT: Use client's timestamp
    reading = TrackingReading.objects.create(
        user=request.user,
        latitude=data['latitude'],
        longitude=data['longitude'],
        timestamp=data['time']  # ✅ Use client's timestamp
    )
```

**2. Database Schema**
Check if `timestamp` field has `auto_now_add=True` or similar:
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Auto-generates timestamp
timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

# ✅ CORRECT: Accepts timestamp from request
timestamp = models.DateTimeField()
```

**3. Timezone Handling**
Check if server is converting UTC to local time incorrectly:
```python
# Client sends: 2025-12-03T13:03:07.715637Z (UTC)
# Server might be treating this as local time
# Then converting to UTC (adding offset)
# Result: Wrong timestamp in database
```

**4. Database Timestamps**
Run this query to see actual data:
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    timestamp,
    created_at
FROM tracking_readings
WHERE user_id = 'a16f7ab3-f9e3-4753-af2b-55710a69959c'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Look for:**
- Is `timestamp` different from `created_at`?
- Are multiple readings sharing the same timestamp?
- Is timestamp pattern random (not sequential)?

### Request Fields to Verify

**Client sends this JSON:**
```json
{
  "latitude": 51.700169,
  "longitude": 5.2700516,
  "time": "2025-12-03T13:03:07.715637Z"
}
```

**Backend should store:**
- `latitude`: 51.700169 ✅ (currently working)
- `longitude`: 5.2700516 ✅ (currently working)
- `timestamp`: 2025-12-03T13:03:07.715637Z ❌ (currently broken)

### Recommended Backend Fixes

**Fix 1: Use client timestamp**
```python
timestamp = datetime.fromisoformat(data['time'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
reading.timestamp = timestamp
```

**Fix 2: Validate timestamp is reasonable**
```python
# Reject if timestamp is > 1 minute in future/past
now = timezone.now()
diff = abs((timestamp - now).total_seconds())
if diff > 60:
    return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid timestamp'}, status=400)
```

**Fix 3: Add logging to diagnose**
```python
logger.info(f"Client sent timestamp: {data['time']}")
logger.info(f"Storing as: {reading.timestamp}")
```

## Files to Screenshot

1. **`lib/managers/api_managers/tracking_cache_manager.dart`** - Lines ~140-160 (Timer.periodic sending every 10s)
2. **`lib/data_managers/tracking_api.dart`** - Lines ~80-120 (addTrackingReading with timestamp)
3. **Terminal/Logcat output** - Examples of sent vs returned timestamps (the evidence)
4. **`lib/screens/location/kaart_overview_screen.dart`** - Lines ~450-480 (24h fallback workaround)

---

## Result

### Current Status

**Client Side: ✅ Working Correctly**
- Sends location every 10 seconds exactly
- Includes accurate UTC timestamp
- Timestamp format correct (ISO 8601)
- Offline caching preserves original timestamps
- All 2670 cached readings sent successfully

**Backend Side: ❌ Broken**
- Ignores client-provided timestamp
- Generates random/incorrect server timestamps
- Time differences range from -13 min to +19 min
- Sometimes reuses timestamps for multiple readings
- Makes time-based filtering impossible

**User Impact:**
- Cannot filter to last 5 minutes (shows 0 results)
- Tracking history shows 24-hour window instead
- Real-time tracking visualization doesn't work as designed
- Workaround functional but not ideal

### Evidence Summary

From logs on 03/12/2025 at ~13:00-13:10:

**Total readings sent:** 60+ (every 10 seconds)  
**Timestamp accuracy:** 100% correct from client  
**Backend corruption rate:** 100% (every timestamp modified)  
**Average time difference:** 5-19 minutes (random direction)

**Example log sequence:**
```
Client → Backend (what happened)
13:02:37 → 13:07:17 (+4m 40s)
13:02:47 → 13:02:27 (-20s)
13:02:57 → 13:07:27 (+4m 30s)
13:03:07 → 13:22:17 (+19m 10s)  ← Worst case
13:03:17 → 13:03:47 (+30s)
13:03:27 → 13:22:27 (+19m)      ← Same huge offset
```

### Next Steps

**For Backend Team:**
1. Review `POST /tracking-reading/` endpoint implementation
2. Check if `timestamp` field has auto-generation enabled
3. Verify timezone conversion logic
4. Add logging to diagnose where corruption happens
5. Fix to use client-provided timestamp
6. Deploy fix to test environment
7. Verify with client app testing

**For Client Team (Me):**
- ✅ Implementation is correct, no client changes needed
- ✅ Workaround (24h fallback) keeps feature functional
- ⏳ Once backend fixed, remove workaround and use 5-min filter
